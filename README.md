# ZeroDeposit

**The Aim**

You are the developer of an online artisan cheese shop called Ned Ned's Cheese Emporium. Your customers are UK based and pay you £19.99 per order.

You buy your cheese from France in euros, in order to make a profit you must charge at least 3.24€ per block of cheese sold.

Create a website which shows how many blocks of cheese your customers will get for their £19.99.

For example if 1 pound was worth 2 euros then our customers would get 12 pieces of cheese for their £19.99 and the website would look like index.html.

Tips:

    You can use any webframework or language you like
    Use the https://openexchangerates.org/ API to get the pound to euro exchange rate in realtime, use the free version https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free
    Include a README of how to get the project installed
    Use git for version control and put the code on Github
    Write tests in the ways you normally would when building a web app

## Tech Stack

ReactJS and Jest with enzyme and sinon

**Why?**

ZeroDeposit use React and want someone to be able to use the technology. Furthermore,
it is well suited to the front end appearance I want to create. JS can handle the logic while
React can create a presentable and fast front end.


## Installation

- Run 'git clone https://github.com/JoshuaJFHolloway/ZD' in your terminal


## Usage

- Run 'npm install'
- Run 'npm start'
- Visit 'localhost:3000' in your browser to see the app


## Approach

#### Planning

After deciding on the technology I drew out on a piece of paper how I want the website to look. With this
I was able to start working out what components I wanted where and where state would be kept.

#### API

Knowing that a lot of this task would be around successfully tapping into the openexchange API, I spent time
reading up on the documentation on how I would best access all the information needed for the page.

#### Reusable components

Making sure that I don't waste time writing code that could have been replaced by reusing prior code was 
also a focus. One of the best parts of React is how code is reused and its important to a slim and efficient app.

#### Reusing handlers

I was also aware of not writing out multiple event handlers when I can mould one to do most, if not all, the events
while still abiding to the SRP. 


## Future Additions

- Use jest-styled-components to test my styled components
- Work out why using 'extend' on styled components didn't work. Would be useful to extend the HeaderStyle for the SubHeaderStyle as it uses many of the same properties.
- Test the api more and test the ResultsHolder component. I havent had much experience testing a stateless component
so I ran into a few issues. What I will be doing is either passing props into it in the test and seeing what it returns
or converting the function expressions into functions that I export and then test that way.
- I want to create a dropdown box where you can enter the currency you want to pay with and it would convert it into
cheese for you. This wouldn't be too difficult and I'll do it later today.
